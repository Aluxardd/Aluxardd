👋 Hi, I’m Sergio: a Computing student at the University of Bolton.
💻 I’m passionate about full-stack development, building web applications using JavaScript, Python, and C#.
🛠️ I work with frameworks like React, Node.js, Django, and enjoy working with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
📚 I’m continuously learning and improving my skills through freeCodeCamp, Coursera, Codecademy, and Microsoft Learn.
🚀 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, contribute to real-world applications, and grow as a developer.
